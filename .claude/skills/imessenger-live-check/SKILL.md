name: imessenger-live-check
description: Check in the real iMessenger app what happens when the computer sleeps, the network dies or comes back, Messenger's encrypted chats' worker dies ("Couldn't load chats"), and when a notification rings. Run it before shipping any change to connections, reloading, notifications or sounds (19-recover, 14-notifications, 05-messenger-prefs, notify.rs), and when a user reports stuck "Sending", missing notifications or sounds, or a blank or error screen. Fix by simulating the case, not by releasing and waiting for reports.

# Live check

`tests/app/live-check.sh [wake] [network] [chats] [sound]` (all four by default;
macOS). It needs a debug build that can go through a proxy:

```
npx tauri build --debug --bundles app --features test-proxy
```

It quits the running iMessenger, runs the debug app through `tests/app/net-proxy.py`
(a local CONNECT proxy that can cut the network), and opens the installed iMessenger
again at the end. The window isn't brought forward (`IMESSENGER_PROBE_NO_FOCUS`).
It prints `PASS`/`FAIL` per case, then `PASSED` or `FAILED (n)`; logs go to
`$LIVE_OUT` or a temp folder (each case's `app.log`, `proxy.jsonl`, `stats.json`).
About 25 minutes for all four.

## How things are made up

| What | How |
|---|---|
| Network dies silently (sleep, Wi-Fi drop, NAT) | proxy `blackhole`: open tunnels pass nothing and never close; new ones get no answer |
| Offline | proxy `refuse`: open tunnels close, new ones refused at once |
| Every connection dropped | proxy `reset` |
| Sleep | a clock jump between two ticks of 19-recover's timer (`window.__imessengerCheckAwake(now)`, debug) |
| A message being typed | a hidden contenteditable with text, focused (not Messenger's box, so nobody sees "typing…") |
| "Couldn't load chats" (#24) | Messenger's own `MAWSetupWorker.setPreventWorkerRestart(true)` + `terminateWorker`, then work for the worker (reading ahead encrypted chats, which opens none) |
| Messenger's sound | its real `MWLSChatPopperCommon.playChatTabSound(message)` |
| Do Not Disturb, Messenger's sounds | `__imessengerSetMessengerPref('muteFor' / 'soundsOn')`, reported at once (`__imessengerReportMessengerPrefs`), put back as they were |
| The Mac muted | the probe logs `sound: mute`; the script runs `set volume output muted true` and puts it back |
| Windows' ring decision on a Mac | `window.__imessengerRingAnywhere = true` (debug) |

Debug builds log what the page does: `[page] main recover: … @<ms>` (19-recover),
`window.__imessengerSockets` (every WebSocket: opened, closed, last frame each way),
and `[imessenger] notify #n: <title> (…, sound true|false)`.

## Cases

**wake**
- a timer a minute late (a hidden page's timer) doesn't reload; a 2-minute sleep doesn't
- after a 6-minute sleep: no reload while a message is being typed, reload once it's sent
- after the reload, messages (gateway.facebook.com) and encrypted chats (web-chat-e2ee) talk to Facebook within 20 s
- waking with the network off, then dead: no reload until it's back, reload within 10 s after

**network** (no sleep)
- a minute of dead network: messages back within 10 s by Messenger itself; iMessenger reloads at most once, within 60 s, for the connections Messenger leaves down
- every connection dropped: back within 10 s, no reload
- 30 s offline: back within 60 s
- 2.5 minutes offline: iMessenger reloads within 60 s of the network coming back (Messenger had given up on its calls connection), and everything talks to Facebook within 75 s

**chats** (#24)
- the worker dies for good: Messenger shows its error screen, iMessenger reloads within 30 s, encrypted chats talk to Facebook again
- the same within 10 minutes of iMessenger's last reload for it: the screen stays (Messenger's own Reload can also clear and refetch the encrypted chats stored on the computer)

**sound** (decided as on Windows, plus macOS's own rule)
- after Messenger's sound played, the notification is quiet (one sound per message)
- no sound from Messenger (its 4th message in a chat, or its sound failed): it rings
- a notification asking for silence: quiet
- Do Not Disturb on: quiet, and Messenger quiet too; off again: rings
- Messenger's sounds off: quiet; on again: rings
- the Mac muted: Messenger's sound still counts as played, so quiet; without it, it rings (the system keeps it quiet)
- macOS: notifications stay silent (Messenger plays its own)
- each case checks the page's decision and what iMessenger's native side was told

## What Messenger and WebKit do on their own (measured 2026-11-05)

Messenger keeps four WebSockets to gateway.facebook.com (`/ws/lightspeed`
messages, `/ws/realtime`, `/ws/rpsignaling` calls, `/ws/streamcontroller`) and
the encrypted chats' worker keeps one to web-chat-e2ee.facebook.com.
- A silent death: it notices in 11–13 s and keeps trying; lightspeed and
  rpsignaling are back within 2 s of the network, but realtime and
  streamcontroller were left down (over 2.5 minutes, until a reload).
- Offline: it retries with growing gaps, lightspeed every ~75 s after a few
  minutes, so it came back 77 s after the network did; rpsignaling tries every
  second and gives up after ~110 s, for good.
- The dead socket of a silent death is never closed: the newest socket of each
  kind is the one in use.
- A dead worker is restarted by itself, unless it can't (the #24 screen).
- WebKit keeps sending HTTP requests to a host down its pooled connection after
  a silent death until it gives up on it, 44 s later; a request to a host the
  page doesn't use (m.facebook.com) goes out on a new one. 19-recover asks both.

## Still by hand

- Windows: the real toast sound (a `test build` labelled PR; install it in the
  Windows VM). Settings → Send Test Notification rings; one message rings once;
  Do Not Disturb or Messenger's sounds off: silent.
- A real night's sleep (the morning after: send a message, it goes).
- A muted group: Messenger doesn't notify for it, and iMessenger's own notification
  leaves muted chats out (14-notifications, unread chats); needs someone to write
  in a muted group.
- Messages waiting at "Sending" go out after a reload: needs a chat you may send
  test messages to.

## Adding a case

Make it up at the proxy or with Messenger's own calls, never with a real chat
someone else sees. A probe that gets the page reloaded loses its result: log
from the page with `window.__imessengerErrors?.push('<what>: … @' + Date.now())` and
judge in `live-check.sh` with `judge`/`at`/`reloads`/`back`.
